      "Graphical representation of our main result. We are considering the notion of standard joint mea- surability (JM) and its various generalizations, depicted here in their operational interpretation. In all cases, we consider a set M of m measurements with inputs x ∈[m] and outputs a. These measurements are per- formed on a state ρ ∈L(Cd) and lead to the statistics p(a|x) = Tr[Ma|xρ]. Standard joint measurability asks, whether there exists a single measurement {M ′ a′}a′, which leads to the same statistics for any state ρ, using appropriate deterministic post-processing of the measurement outcomes a′. Deterministic n-simulability (SIMDet n ) asks whether m measurements can be simulated using n < m measurements, and deterministic pre- and post-processing. More generally, n-simulability (SIMn) considers the same question but allows for proba- bilistic pre-and post-processing. The conv (n-simulability) model (Conv(SIMn)) allows for (shared) randomness between the pre-processing, the performed quantum measurements, and the post-processing and corresponds geometrically to the convex hull of n-simulability. Finally, n-copy joint measurability (Copyn) allows only for a single simulating measurement {M ′ a′}a′ as in standard joint measurability, however, it is allowed to act on n copies of a state ρ simultaneously. In all circuits, there is a notion of causality from left (earlier) to the right (later). Classical information is represented by double-lines while quantum information, in form of a d- dimensional quantum state ρ ∈L(Cd), is represented by a single line. Deterministic functions are denoted by f, g, while probabilistic processes are denoted by p, q. The strict set inclusion ⊂between each of the circuits, represents the strict hierarchy of assemblages that can be simulated with a given model, corresponding to Eq. (1).",

Ground state algorithms encompass hybrid quantum–classical algorithms, including auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), unitary coupled-cluster Monte Carlo (UCCMC), variational Monte Carlo (VMC), selected configuration interaction (Selected CI), and entanglement forging. Cooling with Monte Carlo-flavored Lindbladians is covered as a fully quantum algorithm for ground state calculation. In the thermal state calcu- lation category, the algorithms include quantum-enhanced classical Monte Carlo, stochastic series expansion (SSE), quantum Metropolis, and minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) as hybrid methods, complemented by quantum-quantum Metropolis and Monte Carlo-flavored Lindbladians as fully quantum algorithms. For quantum dynamics, we covered quantum circuit Monte Carlo, hybrid path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC), and Boson sampling. Each hybrid method connects back to the central unit, illustrating the intermediate quantities quantum computing contributes to this methodology."

By repeating this procedure with incrementally va initial energy guesses, a complete spectrum is generated, and suspected resonances—identified by their separation from continuum in the lower complex energy plane—are located. A θ-trajectory calculation is subsequently performed to extract optimal resonance position, indicated by a loop, kink, or slowdown along the trajectory.
